# Tutorials

Copy-pastable working know-hows of reddemcee. Since reddemcee is a wrapper of emcee, emcee's excellent tutorials provide a good insight on how to use this sampler as well.

The following tutorials will display the similarities and differences between samplers, I highly recommend skimming all the contents at minimum.
